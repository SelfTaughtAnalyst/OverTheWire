Bandit is a fantastic war game for beginners who are looking to learn the absolute basics of how wargames/CTFs work as well as those looking to gain some familiarity with the Linux command line. You don't need to have Linux installed, you just need to be able to SSH into their machines which most modern systems should be able to do nowadays. If you don't know how SSH works, don't worry as that's what level 0 is about.

This game covers a ton of topics at an introductory level and it's normal to feel overwhelmed learning about it all. Each level has a ton of interconnected topics that you can deep dive into and you can easily get lost in the rabbit hole of information. As Bandit's main page suggests, **don't panic and don't give up**. Take things slow and spend time Googling things you don't understand. Also don't be afraid to take a break from a topic and come back to it later; you might learn more things down the line that help with something you didn't get before. If this is all new to you, I recommend circling back and going through all the levels again after completing them once. This allows you to see what knowledge you've retained and to approach the problems with a fresh set of eyes and different perspective.

This repo is organized into folders with each level having its own corresponding folder and README. On the site, levels are written as "Level X -> Level Y' which can raise some ambiguity when referencing a particular level. In this write up, levels will be referenced by the username used to log in. For example, logging in with bandit0 means that we are on level 0 and all the corresponding write up to get to the next level will be in the folder Level-0.
